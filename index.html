    <p>Sphere (also known as Sphere at the Venetian Resort or Las Vegas Sphere) is a music and entertainment arena in
        Paradise, Nevada, United States, east of the Las Vegas Strip. Designed by Populous, the project was announced by
        the Madison Square Garden Company in 2018, known then as the MSG Sphere. The venue, which seats 17,600 people
        and has total capacity of 20,000, is being marketed for its immersive video and audio capabilities, which
        include a 16K resolution wraparound interior LED screen, speakers with beamforming and wave field synthesis
        technologies, and 4D physical effects. The venue's exterior also features 580,000 sq ft (54,000 m2) of LED
        displays, making it the largest in the world.[2] Sphere measures 366 feet (112 m) high and 516 feet (157 m)
        wide. The arena cost $2.3 billion,[3] making it the most expensive entertainment venue built in the Las Vegas
        Valley.

        Sphere opened on September 29, 2023, with Irish rock band U2 beginning a 40-show residency called U2:UV Achtung
        Baby Live at Sphere. Director Darren Aronofsky's docu-film Postcard from Earth opened on October 6, 2023. Since
        its opening, the venue has also hosted residencies of various lengths for Phish, Dead & Company, the Eagles, and
        the Backstreet Boys, and has begun screening an immersive 4D version of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. The
        venue is owned by Sphere Entertainment, a spin-off of MSG Company.</p>
