    <p>Spider-Man is a superhero in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee
        and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the
        Silver Age of Comic Books. Considered one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes, he has
        been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.

        Spider-Man is the secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker, who was raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in
        Queens, New York City, after the death of his parents. Lee, Ditko, and later writers had the character deal with
        the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood. Readers identified with his self-doubt and loneliness. Unlike
        previous teen heroes, Spider-Man was not a sidekick nor did he have a mentor. He would be given many supporting
        characters, such as his Daily Bugle boss J. Jonah Jameson; friends like Harry Osborn and Flash Thompson;
        romantic interests like Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the
        Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Peter gets his superhuman spider-powers and abilities after he was
        bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers include superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes and
        durability; clinging to surfaces and ceilings; and detecting danger with his precognitive "spider-sense". He
        sews a spider-web patterned spandex costume that fully covers his body and builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter"
        devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses for both fighting and "web swinging"
        across the city. Peter initially used his powers for personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a
        burglar that he could have stopped but did not, he learned that "with great power comes great responsibility",
        and began to use his powers to fight crime as Spider-Man.

        Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is The
        Amazing Spider-Man. Since his introduction, the main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a high school
        student to attending college to currently being somewhere in his late 20s. Peter has been a member of numerous
        superhero teams, most notably the Avengers and Fantastic Four. Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a
        story arc spanning 2012–2014 following the "Dying Wish" storyline, where Peter appears to die after Doctor
        Octopus orchestrates a body swap with him and becomes the Superior Spider-Man. Marvel has also published comic
        books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of
        Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenage
        Peter Parker in the alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, which depicts a teenager named Miles
        Morales who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later became a
        superhero in his own right and was brought into mainstream continuity during the Secret Wars event, where he
        sometimes works alongside the mainline version of Peter.

        Spider-Man has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated TV series, a live-action
        television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and multiple series of films. In live-action films,
        Spider-Man has been portrayed by Tobey Maguire in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Andrew Garfield in The Amazing
        Spider-Man duology directed by Marc Webb, and Tom Holland in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Peter Parker
        version of Spider-Man was also voiced by Jake Johnson and Chris Pine in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the
        Spider-Verse, with the former reprising his role in the sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.</p>
